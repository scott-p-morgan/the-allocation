The Allocation is an open-source resource for FinTech product, engineering, and strategy. We focus on how AI can be used to build better products and improve the feedback loop between product and engineering, 
especially in the more esoteric parts of FinTech.

We encourage you to contribute to the Allocation. You can get started by opening a PR to add your own article, or by submitting a new issue to the repo. [Here's the repo.](https://github.com/scott-p-morgan/the-allocation)
